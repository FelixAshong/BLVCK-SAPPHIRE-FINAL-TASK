.animate-fade-in-left    /* Slide left + fade in */
.animate-fade-in-right   /* Slide right + fade in */
.animate-scale-in        /* Scale up + fade in */
.animate-pulse-slow      /* 3-second pulse animation */
.animate-float          /* Continuous floating motion */
.hover-lift             /* Lift on hover with shadow */
.hover-glow            /* Lime green glow effect */
